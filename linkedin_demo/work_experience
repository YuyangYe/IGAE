proposing only the two most suitable billboards for the prospect， according to the social flows and areas of interests ( e。g。 Real estate agency advert at the entrance of the historical centre； Restaurants advert 30-50 metres before the location； Pub's advert in front of the train station )。 Auction criteria were implemented only for the shopping centre because of the limited banners available and the higher price， proposing only one space per industry and not allowing competitors to advertise together。Achievements: After a one week training about the sales strategy and techniques， immediately from the first operative week the first achievement was accomplished。A total portfolio of 8 clients has been built plus 3 introduced by a client。.5,Account

How does a single cell become， by division and formation of new cell types， an entire multicellular organism， which in the case of humans has thousands of different cell types and more than 1 trillion different cells in specific places， communicating to form complex organs?
